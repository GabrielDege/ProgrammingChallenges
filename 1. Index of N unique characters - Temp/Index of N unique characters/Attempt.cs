            There us a stream (long string) of random lowercase characters.
            You are given a value called n.
            Return the index (of the stream) of the first occurrence where there is no repetition within n characters.
            If there is no occurrence of n unique characters, then return -1.
            
            Examples: 
                for stream = "abababc" and n = 3, the index would be 4.
                                  ^ ^ -> all unique characters
                for stream = "mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb" and n = 14, the index would be 5.
                                   ^            ^ -> all unique characters
